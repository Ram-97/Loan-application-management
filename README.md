# Loan-application-management
# Abstract:
In India, getting a loan is a very tiring and complicated process as it
may take weeks even months for loan approval and people need to visit the
loan office repeatedly for document submission and verification. This
system is designed to automate the loan process from both, bankers as well
as customer’s side. Here customers get information about various loans
provided along with rate of interest and required documents. Once the
customer fills basic enquiry form, it reaches the bank server and he gets a
login id and password. The server administrator now can check it and decide
whether to approve or reject the candidate. If he decides to approve, the
banker may select to send customer to next stage. Now the customer gets
stage 1 approval and needs to upload his scanned documents to the site
through his login. Once the documents are submitted, they are cross verified
at the server and reply is sent to server. The bank may now cross verify
customer details and request extra documents. The customer just needs to
upload needed documents online and can track loan status. Once loan is
approved, candidate receives a notification, confirming the process.
